# Task Master Completion & Commit Strategy

When completing a task using `task-master-ai` (`complete_task`) or wrapping up a unit of work, you must follow this procedure and format.

## 1. Trigger Condition

This rule activates when:

- The `complete_task` function of the `task_master` tool is called.
- The user requests a midpoint check or finalization of a task currently managed by Task Master.

## 2. Analysis Process

1.  **Task Context**: Check the title and description of the completed task.
2.  **Code Changes**: Analyze the actual files and logic modified while performing the task.
3.  **Commit Type**: Determine the commit type based on the nature of the changes (`feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `chore`, etc.).

## 3. Response Format

Use the following template when reporting task completion:

### ✅ Task Completed: [Task ID/Name]

> _A brief statement confirming the successful completion of the task._

### 📝 Work Summary

- **[Key Change 1]**: (e.g., Implemented `UserProfile` component UI)
- **[Key Change 2]**: (e.g., Added API integration and error handling)
  _(Summarize by mapping Task Master's detailed requirements to the actual code changes)_

### 🚀 Recommended Commit

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "type(scope): description"
```

## 4\. Commit Message Guidelines

- **Type**:
  - `feat`: New features (when adding functionality in Task Master)
  - `fix`: Bug fixes
  - `refactor`: Code structure improvements without functional changes
  - `chore`: Configuration changes, package installation, etc.
- **Scope**: The Task Master task name or affected module name (e.g., `auth`, `ui`, `api`)
- **Description**: Concisely describe "what" and "why" (in English or the project's language convention).

## 5\. Example

**User**: "Finished the login UI work. Mark it as complete."

**AI Response**:
(After calling `complete_task`)

### ✅ Task Completed: Implement Login UI

Login screen publishing and form validation logic implementation are complete.

### 📝 Work Summary

- **LoginPage.tsx**: Implemented email/password input form UI (Applied Tailwind).
- **useLoginForm.ts**: Added React Hook Form + Zod validation logic.
- **routes.ts**: Configured routing for the login page.

### 🚀 Recommended Commit

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat(auth): implement login ui and validation"
```
